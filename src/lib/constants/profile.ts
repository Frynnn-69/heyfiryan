  aboutTLDR: `
I simplify the complex—whether that's AI models, product strategy, or healthcare inefficiencies.

Fifth-year Informatics student with an unusual path: quantitative psychology research taught me that good solutions require understanding people first. From there, I moved into fullstack web and AI engineering, eventually landing on **applied AI product development**—building AI-integrated tools for psychology assessments, document processing, social graph intelligence for fintech, and healthcare referrals.

Led a team of first-timers to **Top 15** at the **Amartha x GDG Jakarta Hackathon 2025** (out of 150+ teams). Delivered a Product Management session to **200+ people** at GDGoC UG. The feedback I hear most: *"You made this actually make sense."*

Currently building a healthcare AI referral system to address hospital inefficiency in Indonesia—a problem that affects millions but flies under the radar.

// Here's how I learned to prioritize the right problems—through unexpected experiences.
  aboutFull: `
My first real lesson in this came **in 2022**, during a gap year, helping my partner with psychology research. I conducted qualitative interviews and ran statistical analysis in SPSS—completely outside my comfort zone as an informatics student. We won second place in a regional research competition across Central Java and contributed to published articles. More importantly, I learned that good solutions require understanding people first, not just impressive technology.

That philosophy got tested at the Amartha x GDG Jakarta Hackathon 2025. My team registered just five days before the deadline—a group of mostly first-timers with zero industry-scale hackathon experience. Out of 150+ teams (including students from ITB, UI, and industry professionals), we made it to the Top 15.
The unconventional part? During the initial 24-hour brainstorming phase, we imposed a rule: **"No AI for 24 Hours."** While other teams used LLMs to generate ideas, we used human judgment to deeply understand Amartha's Grameen Model and identify the real problem—risk validation bias, not just process efficiency. AI came in later for implementation, where it excels. The approach worked: we advanced to the final round—24 hours of live coding and pitching to judges.

**Before the hackathon, in late 2024**, I joined the core Product Management team at Google Developer Group on Campus (GDGoC UG) and delivered a session to 200+ people. From there, mentorship followed naturally—starting with GDGoC's Bootcamp Kilat in early 2025, then paid teaching gigs at vocational school in Jakarta. That clarity seems to resonate—people often tell me they finally "get it" after sessions. That's not separate from technical work; it's the same skill. Clear thinking enables both good solutions and good communication.

Right now, I'm building a healthcare AI referral system—a problem that sounds niche but affects millions. Misreferrals waste hospital resources, delay critical treatment, and disproportionately hurt patients with certain conditions. It's a systems problem disguised as a logistics one, requiring both technical depth (model tuning, vector databases, real-time integration) and product thinking: What does "better" actually mean for doctors, patients, and hospital operations?

**This is where complexity gets interesting—not in the models themselves, but in making them work for people who don't care about vector embeddings, just better outcomes.** The project is ongoing—**[track progress here](#)**. <span class="relative inline-flex h-2 w-2 ml-1 items-center justify-center translate-y-px"><span class="animate-ping absolute top-0 left-0 inline-flex h-full w-full rounded-full bg-red-400 opacity-75"></span><span class="relative inline-flex rounded-full h-2 w-2 bg-red-500"></span></span>
